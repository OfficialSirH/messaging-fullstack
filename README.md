# Basic Realtime Chat App

### This is a basic realtime chat app built with React and Rust.

**This is primarily a learning project for me to learn React, Websockets, and generally how to make a chat app.**

*There are a few issues with the frontend with websocket connections opening twice, since I'm not that familiar with React yet. So if you mess around with this, be aware of that silliness*
